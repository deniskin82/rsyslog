<h2>$AboortOnUncleanConfig</h2>
<p><b>Type:</b> global configuration directive</p>
<p><b>Parameter Values:</b> boolean (on/off, yes/no)</p>
<p><b>Available since:</b> 5.3.1+</p>
<p><b>Default:</b> off</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>This directive permits to prevent rsyslog from running when the configuration file
is not clean. "Not Clean" means there are errors or some other annoyances that rsyslgod 
reports on startup. This is a user-requested feature to have a strict startup mode. Note
that with the current code base it is not always possible to differentiate between an
real error and a warning-like condition. As such, the startup will also prevented if
warnings are present. I consider this a good thing in being &quot;strict&quot;, but I admit
there also currently is no other way of doing it.
<p><b>Caveats:</b></p>
Note that the consequences of a failed rsyslogd startup can be much more serious than a
startup with only partial configuration. For example, log data may be lost or systems that
depend on the log server in question will not be able to send logs, what in the ultimate
result could result in a system hang on those systems. Also, the local system may hang when
the local log socket has become full and is not read. There exist many such scenarios.
As such, it is strongly recommended not to turn on this directive.
